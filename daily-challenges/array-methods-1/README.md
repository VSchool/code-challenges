You should use multiple array methods to solve these problems. Don't use `for` loops!

Using the provided `peopleArray` (bottom of this article), write a function that:

1. Returns a list of everyone older than 18, which is
1. sorted alphabetically by last name, and where
1. each name and age is embedded in a string that looks like an HTML `<li>` element.

#### Example

```js
function sortedOfAge(arr){
   // Your code here
}

console.log(sortedOfAge(peopleArray));

/*
Output: 
[ 
    "<li>Kyle Mooney is 27</li>",
    "<li>Sarah Palin is 47</li>",
    "<li>Rick Sanchez is 78</li>",
    "<li>Morty Smith is 29</li>",
    "<li>Lev Tolstoy is 82</li>" 
]
*/
```

## Extra Credit
* Create another array of one or more individuals and add it to the original array.
* Create a function that filters out all people who's last names end with "y" or "a" and save those people in another array.
* Remove the second individual from the array.
* Return the array in reverse order.
