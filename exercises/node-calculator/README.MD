You are going to create a calculator in pure Javascript using `NodeJS` and `readline-sync`.

#### Your script must have:
* A function that adds two numbers and returns the result
* A function that multiplies two numbers and returns the result
* A function that divides two numbers and returns the result
* A function that subtracts two numbers and returns the result
* Each function will have 2 parameters, `num1`, `num2`
* On the console the prompt will print to the user:
* Please enter your first number (store that number)
* Please enter your second number (store that number)
* Please enter the operation to perform: *add*, *sub*, *mul*, *div* (then store the operation)
* Based on the operation entered by the user, you will call one of your 4 functions to perform the correct operation
* You will then print to the console: The result is: [the result]

#### To get set up:
* `cd` into the project folder
* run `npm install readline-sync`
* At the top of your JS file, include var readline = require("readline-sync")
* For documentation on the readline-sync package, check out the readline-sync docs on npmjs.org
